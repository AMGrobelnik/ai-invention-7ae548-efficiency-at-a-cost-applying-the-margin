<software_constraints>
- Python only implementation
- Python standard library and all popular PyPI packages available (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, scipy, matplotlib, requests, etc.)
- Local parallelism encouraged: multiprocessing, asyncio, threading — see aii-parallel-computing skill
- LLM API calls must go through OpenRouter only (no direct OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- **HARD LIMIT**: Maximum $10 USD total spend on LLM API calls (OpenRouter). Track cumulative cost after every call and STOP IMMEDIATELY if approaching this limit. Never exceed this budget under any circumstances.
</software_constraints>
</available_resources>

<time_budget>

The evaluation executor has 3h total (including writing code, debugging, testing, and fixing errors).

</time_budget>

<available_tools>
Web research is available through the aii-web-tools skill, in three levels (broad → specific):

1. web search — Returns titles, URLs, snippets. Use first to discover and scan the landscape.
2. web fetch — Reads a page and returns its content as markdown (HTML or PDF). Use to understand a source. May miss specific details — use fetch_grep below if it doesn't find what you need.
3. fetch_grep — Regex search over a page/PDF's full text. Returns exact matching sections with context. Use for precise details, exact numbers, methodology, or PDFs.

Workflow: search → fetch (understand) → fetch_grep (extract specifics).
</available_tools>

<tool_use>
Maximize parallel tool calls. Parallelize independent operations, only sequentialize dependencies.
- Multiple searches/fetches on different topics → parallel in one turn
- Search then fetch results → sequential (need URLs first)
</tool_use>

<plan_guidelines>
You are expanding an artifact direction from the strategy into a detailed plan.
The artifact direction specifies what to do at a high level (type, objective, approach, dependencies).
Your job is to make it concrete and actionable as a detailed plan.
Use web research to look up technical details, verify feasibility, and find reference materials
that will make your plan more concrete and actionable for the executor.

GOOD PLANS:
- Make each component SPECIFIC and actionable (not vague platitudes)
- Consider both success AND failure scenarios
- Build on the approach in the artifact direction
- Add concrete details the executor needs

BAD PLANS:
- Vague hand-waving ("do research on X")
- Ignoring the approach in the artifact direction
- Missing critical details the executor needs
</plan_guidelines>

<system_reminder>
Do not ask follow up questions and do not ask the user anything. Execute all steps independently.
You must follow the todo list provided in each prompt exactly as written.
No placeholders, stubs, or incomplete code — all code must be complete and functional.
</system_reminder>

<process_isolation>
CRITICAL: Multiple pipeline runs may execute simultaneously on this machine. `ps aux | grep method.py` matches ALL runs, not just yours.
- NEVER kill processes by name (`killall`, `pkill -f`, `ps aux | grep ... | xargs kill`). This kills OTHER runs' processes.
- NEVER monitor processes by name (`ps aux | grep method.py`). You will see other runs' processes and get confused.
- ALWAYS use PID-based process management:
  Run: `uv run method.py & PID=$!` or `timeout <seconds> uv run method.py & PID=$!`
  Check: `kill -0 $PID 2>/dev/null && echo "Running" || echo "Ended"`
  Stop: `kill $PID`
  Wait: `wait $PID; echo "Exit code: $?"`
  Monitor: `tail -f logs/run.log & TAIL_PID=$!` then `kill $TAIL_PID` when done

<hypothesis>
kind: hypothesis
title: 'MVT Section Switching: Efficiency-Quality Tradeoff in Scientific RAG'
hypothesis: >-
  The Marginal Value Theorem (MVT) from ecological foraging theory provides an interpretable, parameter-free criterion for
  adaptive section switching in retrieval-augmented generation over long scientific documents, but its naive implementation
  with single-chunk G_env estimation causes systematic under-retrieval that yields lower answer quality than fixed-k baselines.
  Specifically: modeling document sections (introduction, methods, results, discussion) as forageable 'patches' and estimating
  the environment-wide average marginal gain G_env from the single best-matching chunk per section, the MVT criterion triggers
  section switching too aggressively—achieving 4x retrieval efficiency (1.3 vs 5.0 chunks/question) at the cost of significantly
  lower F1 (0.122 vs 0.190 for top-k-5 on QASPER). We hypothesize that replacing the single-chunk G_env estimator with a multi-chunk
  average (mean of top-3 similarity scores per section) or applying a discount factor α < 1 to the raw G_env will substantially
  close the oracle retrieval F1 gap without sacrificing the efficiency advantage, because the corrected estimator will better
  approximate the true expected marginal return rate within each section and avoid premature patch abandonment. The ecology-derived
  adaptive baseline provides no statistically distinguishable benefit over a fixed threshold at current estimation quality,
  but this null result is attributable to G_env estimation noise rather than a flaw in the MVT framework itself.
motivation: >-
  Long scientific documents present a core structural challenge for RAG: relevant evidence is distributed heterogeneously
  across sections with very different information densities (e.g., a dense results section vs. a sparse introduction). Existing
  adaptive RAG methods (FLARE, Stop-RAG, IRCoT) determine *whether* to retrieve more but not *which section* to retrieve from
  next. Hierarchy-aware methods (HIRAG, KohakuRAG) structure retrieval but use similarity scores or heuristics, not principled
  criteria for section transitions. The MVT, developed in 1976 to explain animal foraging behavior, gives an exact, analytically-derived
  switching rule that has been validated across hundreds of biological systems: leave a depleting patch when its current return
  rate equals the environment average. This rule is parameter-free given a baseline estimate, adapts automatically to document
  content, and directly solves the section-switching problem. If it applies, it would give a theoretically grounded alternative
  to black-box RL controllers or hand-tuned thresholds, while being interpretable and computationally lightweight.
assumptions:
- >-
  Scientific documents have section-level structure (intro/methods/results/discussion or similar) that can be reliably detected
  from headers or document metadata, and sections constitute meaningfully distinct 'information patches' with different densities
  of query-relevant content.
- >-
  Marginal semantic information gain within a section is monotonically non-increasing as more chunks are retrieved (diminishing
  returns), a structural property borrowed from foraging theory's assumption of depleting patches.
- >-
  The document-wide average marginal gain—estimated from an initial lightweight pass (e.g., top-1 similarity per section)—serves
  as a stable enough baseline to apply the MVT switching criterion, even though the forager is simultaneously depleting the
  environment.
- >-
  Semantic novelty of a chunk relative to already-retrieved context (approximated as 1 minus maximum cosine similarity to
  any retrieved chunk, weighted by query relevance) is a usable proxy for the 'energy intake rate' in the MVT.
- >-
  The answer to a scientific query is typically distributed across 2-4 sections, making section-switching a meaningful degree
  of freedom (as opposed to queries answerable from a single sentence).
investigation_approach: >-
  1. DATASETS: Use QASPER (full-paper scientific QA with section annotations) and LongBench subset (scientific tasks). These
  are freely available on HuggingFace and have ground-truth evidence locations. 2. SECTION DETECTION: Parse sections using
  regex on headers (##, bold lines, standard section names). 3. CHUNK EMBEDDING: Encode all chunks using sentence-transformers
  (all-MiniLM-L6-v2 on CPU). 4. MVT-RAG ALGORITHM: (a) Estimate environment average G_env by computing the similarity of the
  best matching chunk per section to the query, averaged across sections. (b) For the most promising unvisited section, retrieve
  chunks iteratively; compute marginal gain G_t = sim(chunk_t, query) × (1 - max_sim(chunk_t, already_retrieved)). (c) When
  G_t < G_env, switch to the next highest-potential unvisited section. (d) Terminate when all sections are either exhausted
  or have been switched from. 5. ANSWER GENERATION: Pass retrieved chunks as context to an LLM via OpenRouter (e.g., Llama-3-8B-instruct)
  to generate answers. 6. BASELINES: (a) Top-k dense retrieval (k=3,5,10), (b) FLARE-style confidence stopping, (c) BM25+fixed-k,
  (d) no-RAG baseline. 7. METRICS: Exact match, token-level F1, and retrieval efficiency (chunks retrieved per question).
  Statistical tests using paired bootstrap.
success_criteria: >-
  CONFIRM: MVT-RAG achieves statistically significantly higher F1 (p < 0.05 via bootstrap) than fixed-k dense retrieval on
  QASPER, while retrieving fewer average chunks per question (efficiency gain). Ideally, MVT-RAG is competitive with or beats
  confidence-based adaptive stopping. Secondary: ablation showing that removing the environment-average baseline (replacing
  MVT with a fixed threshold) degrades performance, confirming the ecology-derived averaging mechanism is load-bearing. DISCONFIRM:
  If MVT-RAG performs at or below fixed-k retrieval across all k values, the diminishing-returns assumption fails (sections
  are not meaningful patches) or the marginal gain proxy is too noisy for the MVT signal to be usable. Partial: If MVT-RAG
  helps only for multi-hop questions (≥2 sections required), that scopes the finding to multi-hop scientific QA specifically.

- >-
  InForage (arxiv 2505.09316, 2025): Uses Information Foraging Theory + reinforcement learning to train a search controller
  for multi-source web retrieval. Key difference: InForage models multi-source search across independent documents using RL;
  our approach applies the specific Marginal Value Theorem (an exact optimality criterion, not a learned policy) to intra-document
  section switching within a single long scientific paper—no training required.
- >-
  Stop-RAG (arxiv 2510.14337, 2025): Models iterative retrieval stopping as a finite-horizon MDP, learning a value function
  for 'continue vs. stop.' Key difference: Stop-RAG decides whether to retrieve more globally; MVT-RAG decides which section
  to switch to and when, using an analytically derived (not learned) switching criterion grounded in patch foraging ecology.
- >-
  FLARE (Sun et al. 2023): Uses token-level generation probability to trigger retrieval when the model is uncertain. Key difference:
  FLARE asks 'should I retrieve now?' using LLM confidence; MVT-RAG asks 'which section should I switch to?' using informativeness
  of previously retrieved chunks relative to the document-wide baseline—a structurally different decision.
- >-
  HIRAG / KohakuRAG (2025): Hierarchical RAG methods that organize documents into tree structures and traverse them via LLM-guided
  node selection. Key difference: hierarchy methods use similarity-based greedy selection at each level; MVT-RAG uses a physics-motivated
  rate-comparison criterion for section transitions, requiring no LLM calls during the retrieval phase.
- >-
  Optimal Foraging in Memory Retrieval (arxiv 2511.12759, 2025): Applies MVT to model human semantic memory retrieval (animal-naming
  fluency task) using random walks and Metropolis-Hastings sampling. Key difference: that work models human cognition over
  semantic spaces; our work applies MVT operationally to an engineering system (RAG) with concrete text chunks, document sections
  as patches, and measurable downstream QA performance.
inspiration: >-
  The Marginal Value Theorem (Charnov 1976) is one of the most predictively successful quantitative models in behavioral ecology:
  it predicts that an optimal forager leaves a depleting resource patch exactly when the marginal return rate equals the environment-average
  rate. This rule has been validated in hundreds of animal species and extended to human information search behavior (Pirolli's
  Information Foraging Theory). The key cross-domain insight is structural: scientific documents have the same mathematical
  structure as a patchy foraging environment—heterogeneous section-level information densities, diminishing returns within
  a section, and a switching cost (re-orienting the query context). The MVT's elegance is that it makes a specific, testable,
  parameter-free prediction once you specify what 'energy' (information gain) and 'patch' (document section) mean. No existing
  RAG method uses this ecology-derived optimality criterion for section switching, even though the problem structure it was
  designed to solve maps precisely onto the multi-section retrieval problem.
terms:
- term: Marginal Value Theorem (MVT)
  definition: >-
    A mathematical optimality model from ecology (Charnov 1976) predicting that an optimal forager should leave a resource
    patch when the current marginal return rate within that patch equals the average return rate across the entire foraging
    environment. Requires no tunable threshold parameter—the baseline is derived from the environment itself.
- term: Information patch
  definition: >-
    In this context, a section of a scientific document (e.g., Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion) treated as an ecological
    foraging patch: a spatially cohesive region containing resources (query-relevant information) that are depleted as the
    retriever extracts chunks.
- term: Marginal information gain
  definition: >-
    The incremental semantic novelty contributed by the next retrieved chunk, defined as the query-relevance score of the
    chunk multiplied by (1 minus its maximum cosine similarity to any already-retrieved chunk). Approximates the 'energy intake
    rate' in the MVT.
- term: Environment-average gain (G_env)
  definition: >-
    The document-wide baseline marginal gain rate, estimated as the average of the best-matching chunk similarity score across
    all sections. This serves as the MVT threshold: switch sections when current marginal gain falls below G_env.
- term: Retrieval efficiency
  definition: >-
    Chunks retrieved per correct answer—a key secondary metric capturing the practical benefit of adaptive stopping. MVT-RAG
    is hypothesized to achieve the same or better answer quality as fixed-k retrieval while using fewer chunks on average.
summary: >-
  We propose applying the Marginal Value Theorem from ecological foraging to long scientific document RAG: model each document
  section as a 'foraging patch' and switch sections when the marginal semantic information gain within the current section
  drops to the document-wide average—an analytically derived, parameter-free criterion. This ecologically-grounded switching
  rule addresses the core limitation of current adaptive RAG methods, which decide whether to retrieve more but not which
  section to retrieve from next, and is hypothesized to improve multi-hop scientific QA accuracy while reducing retrieval
  overhead compared to fixed-k and confidence-based baselines.
_relation_rationale: >-
  Same MVT framework; reframed as efficiency-quality tradeoff with G_env miscalibration as the diagnosed root cause.
_confidence_delta: decreased
_key_changes:
- >-
  Primary positive claim (MVT-RAG outperforms fixed-k baselines in F1) is replaced by a negative finding: MVT-RAG significantly
  underperforms top-k-5 (F1=0.122 vs 0.190, p=1.00 in wrong direction).
- >-
  Efficiency advantage is retained as a real but partial contribution: 4x fewer chunks confirmed, but not Pareto-superior
  to top-k-1/2 without quality recovery.
- >-
  G_env estimation (single-chunk per section) is now identified as the primary bottleneck driving under-retrieval, not the
  MVT switching framework itself.
- >-
  G_env ablation null result (CI includes zero vs fixed threshold) is incorporated: the ecology-derived adaptive baseline
  provides no measurable benefit at current estimation quality.
- >-
  Proposed fix is now part of the testable hypothesis: multi-chunk G_env (mean of top-3 per section) or discount factor α
  < 1 as the next experimental target.
- >-
  Framing shifts from 'MVT outperforms baselines' to 'MVT framework is sound but G_env estimator requires correction to realize
  quality gains alongside efficiency gains'.
- >-
  EM=0 anomaly noted as a metric implementation concern requiring verification before final conclusions on absolute performance.

title: MVT-RAG vs Baselines on QASPER Scientific QA
summary: >-
  Implemented and evaluated MVT-RAG (Marginal Value Theorem-based adaptive section switching) against 8 baselines on the QASPER
  scientific QA dataset (100 papers, 223 questions). MVT-RAG uses an ecology-derived stopping criterion: it estimates the
  average information yield across all document sections (G_env) and stops retrieving from the current section when the marginal
  gain (relevance × novelty) drops below this environmental average, then switches to the next most promising section. Baselines:
  top-k dense retrieval (k=3,5,10), BM25 (k=5), confidence-threshold retrieval (0.3, 0.5), MVT-NoEnv ablation (fixed threshold=0.5
  instead of adaptive G_env), and no-RAG. Results on 100 QASPER validation papers (n=223 answerable questions): MVT-RAG F1=0.122
  (1.3 chunks/question), MVT-NoEnv F1=0.119 (1.0 chunks), topk_3 F1=0.165 (3 chunks), topk_5 F1=0.190 (5 chunks), topk_10
  F1=0.203 (10 chunks), BM25-5 F1=0.178 (5 chunks), thresh_0.3 F1=0.175 (8.8 chunks), thresh_0.5 F1=0.148 (2.4 chunks), no_rag
  F1=0.061. Oracle retrieval F1 (span recall): MVT-RAG=0.140, topk_5=0.441, topk_10=0.596. MVT-RAG retrieves far fewer chunks
  (1.3 vs 5) but achieves lower F1, indicating the current G_env threshold is too aggressive in stopping—it under-retrieves
  relative to what the LLM needs. Bootstrap p-values show MVT-RAG is significantly worse than topk_5 (p=1.00). The MVT-NoEnv
  ablation performs similarly to MVT-RAG (F1=0.119 vs 0.122), suggesting the ecology-derived G_env averaging provides minimal
  additional benefit over a fixed threshold at these scales. Key findings: (1) the MVT framework successfully controls retrieval
  budget (1.3 chunks vs 5-10 for baselines), (2) but the efficiency gain comes at a large quality cost, (3) the section-switching
  heuristic does not improve over the ablation, pointing to G_env estimation as the weakest component. LLM: meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct
  via OpenRouter. Embeddings: all-MiniLM-L6-v2. Total cost: ~$0.40.

<instructions>
YOUR ROLE: Write a detailed PLAN for the artifact. A separate executor agent runs the actual artifact later.

You are a PLANNER, not an executor. Your output is a plan that tells the executor what to do and how.
Do NOT execute the artifact itself — a separate agent handles that. Your job is to plan it so well that the executor can follow your plan step by step.

You CAN and SHOULD: search the web, read papers, and explore library docs to make your plan concrete.
You CANNOT run shell commands or scripts — code execution is disabled. Research via web tools only.

Do NOT do the executor's job: don't download datasets, don't implement code, don't run experiments, don't write proofs, don't compute evaluations.

<artifact_executor_scope>
IMPORTANT: Each artifact executor has a focused prompt that guides it to do ONE thing well. It will NOT perform tasks outside its scope — assigning the wrong work to the wrong artifact type wastes an iteration. Match the task to the right executor.

EVALUATION executor scope:
  Output: eval_out.json with evaluation results
  DOES: Any evaluation of experiment results — metrics, statistical tests, ablations, comparisons, visualizations, robustness checks, error analysis, etc.
  DOES NOT: Implement new methods (use EXPERIMENT), collect data (use DATASET)
  This is for analyzing experiment outputs from any angle
</artifact_executor_scope>

<artifact_planning_rules>
EVALUATION: Must depend on at least one EXPERIMENT. Focus on statistical rigor and validity checks.
</artifact_planning_rules>

<compute_profiles>
Choose the compute profile this artifact needs for execution.
Available profiles for evaluation artifacts:
  - gpu: 1x NVIDIA RTX A4500, 20GB VRAM, 7 vCPUs, 29GB RAM — ML training, CUDA, large models (fallback: GPUs cheap→expensive: 2000 Ada → A4000 → 4000 Ada → L4 → 4090 → 5090)
  - cpu_heavy: 4 vCPUs, 32GB RAM — large datasets, memory-intensive processing (fallback: CPUs cheap→expensive, then GPU hosts cheap→expensive (all ≥32GB RAM))

Set runpod_compute_profile to one of these exact tier names.
</compute_profiles>
GOOD PLANS: specific, actionable, consider failure scenarios, build on the suggested approach.
BAD PLANS: vague hand-waving, ignoring the suggested approach, missing critical executor details.
