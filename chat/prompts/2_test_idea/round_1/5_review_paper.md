# Introduction

Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) [1] has become the dominant paradigm for grounding large language model (LLM) responses in document evidence. For short documents, global top-$k$ dense retrieval [2] suffices: a query is embedded, the $k$ nearest chunks are retrieved, and an LLM generates from the concatenated context. For long scientific papers—which can span 8,000–20,000 tokens across structurally heterogeneous sections—top-$k$ retrieval faces a fundamental coverage-versus-precision tradeoff. With $k$ too small, critical evidence in minority sections is missed. With $k$ too large, the context window fills with irrelevant text that degrades LLM answer quality and increases cost.

The heterogeneity of scientific documents is not accidental but structural. A typical NLP paper's IMRaD structure (Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion) places different types of information in different locations: experimental setup in Methods, quantitative outcomes in Results, broader interpretations in Discussion. A question about a specific number naturally points to Results; a question about motivation points to Introduction. Any retrieval strategy that ignores this section structure treats all chunks as exchangeable, discarding information that is immediately available from document layout.

Adaptive retrieval methods such as FLARE [3] and IRCoT [4] address the question of *when* to retrieve by conditioning retrieval on generation uncertainty or chain-of-thought state. Stop-RAG [5] frames the continuation decision as a finite-horizon Markov decision process with a learned value function. These methods improve over fixed-$k$ retrieval in multi-hop settings but share a common limitation: they decide whether to retrieve more content globally, without regard for *which section* to retrieve from next. Hierarchy-aware approaches such as HIRAG structure retrieval around document trees, but select nodes via similarity scores rather than principled criteria for section transitions.

We draw on a complementary tradition: optimal foraging theory from behavioral ecology. The *Marginal Value Theorem* (MVT), introduced by Charnov [6] in 1976, provides an exact, analytically derived criterion for when a forager should leave a depleting resource patch: depart when the current marginal return rate within the patch falls to the environment-wide average. This rule—derived under optimality assumptions—has been validated across hundreds of animal species and extended to human information search behavior by Pirolli's Information Foraging Theory [7]. Crucially, the structural analogy to scientific RAG is precise: sections are patches, retrieved chunks deplete available information within a section, and the document-wide average of per-section best-match similarities provides a natural estimate of the environmental average return.

We propose MVT-RAG, which operationalizes the MVT for section-switching in scientific RAG. The algorithm (1) estimates the environmental average gain $G_{\text{env}}$ from a lightweight initial pass over all sections, (2) iteratively retrieves chunks from the most promising unvisited section, computing marginal gain as relevance weighted by novelty relative to already-retrieved content, and (3) switches to the next highest-potential section when the current marginal gain drops below $G_{\text{env}}$.

[FIGURE:fig1]

We evaluate MVT-RAG on the QASPER benchmark [8], a collection of 888 full NLP papers with 8,000+ information-seeking questions and annotated evidence paragraphs. Our main findings are:

**Summary of Contributions:**
- We propose the first application of the Marginal Value Theorem to intra-document section switching in RAG, providing a parameter-free, training-free, analytically grounded switching criterion (Section 3).
- MVT-RAG achieves a 4$\times$ reduction in retrieval overhead compared to top-$k$-5 retrieval (1.3 vs. 5.0 chunks/question) and significantly outperforms the no-retrieval baseline (F1 delta +0.168, $p$=0.002) on QASPER (Section 5).
- We diagnose the primary failure mode: the G_env threshold derived from single-chunk section sampling is systematically too aggressive, causing under-retrieval and a significant quality gap versus top-$k$ baselines (Section 6).
- An ablation study shows that the ecology-derived dynamic G_env baseline is not statistically distinguishable from a fixed threshold at current scales, isolating G_env estimation as the key component requiring improvement (Section 6).

# Background

## Marginal Value Theorem

The Marginal Value Theorem [6] addresses the optimal foraging problem: given an environment consisting of patches with heterogeneous resource densities that deplete as resources are extracted, when should a forager leave the current patch to travel to a new one? Charnov showed that under mild regularity conditions (unimodal gain curves, constant travel cost), the optimal departure rule is: *leave the current patch when its instantaneous return rate equals the long-run average return rate across the entire environment*.

Formally, if $g_t$ denotes the marginal gain at time step $t$ within the current patch, and $G_{\text{env}}$ is the environment-wide average gain, the MVT switching condition is:
$$g_t < G_{\text{env}}$$
This rule is parameter-free once $G_{\text{env}}$ is specified, and it adapts automatically to the forager's current environment without requiring a hand-tuned threshold.

## Information Foraging Theory

Pirolli [7] extended optimal foraging models to human information search, showing that users navigate information environments—web pages, document corpora—using strategies that resemble those of biological foragers. Under the *information scent* hypothesis, users follow navigational cues (links, headings, keywords) that predict information gain in adjacent regions, leaving a current information source when its scent drops relative to alternatives. This theoretical framing motivates our use of section headers and similarity scores as proxies for ecological patch membership and resource density.

A closely related recent work, InForage [9], applies Information Foraging Theory with reinforcement learning to train a search controller for multi-source web retrieval. Unlike InForage—which learns a policy over independent documents—MVT-RAG applies the specific MVT optimality criterion to intra-document section switching within a single paper, requiring no training. Moore [10] applies MVT to model human semantic memory retrieval (animal-naming fluency tasks); our work differs in applying MVT as an engineering criterion with measurable downstream QA performance.

# Method

## Section Parsing and IMRaD Normalization

MVT-RAG operates on sections as atomic foraging patches. We parse sections from QASPER's columnar `section_name`/`paragraphs` schema, then normalize section names to six IMRaD-inspired categories: *introduction*, *methods*, *results*, *discussion*, *related\_work*, and *other*. The normalization uses keyword matching on section headers (e.g., "experiment" and "evaluation" map to *results*; "approach" and "model" map to *methods*). Papers with fewer than three distinct normalized categories are excluded; 776 of 888 training papers and 265 of 281 validation papers pass this filter [ARTIFACT:art_jHUX0qukOYMI].

Each paragraph within a section becomes one chunk. We encode all chunks and queries with `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` [11], a lightweight sentence embedding model that runs on CPU without additional dependencies.

## MVT-RAG Algorithm

Let $\mathcal{S} = \{s_1, \ldots, s_m\}$ denote the set of document sections and $q$ the query vector. The algorithm proceeds in three phases:

**Phase 1: Environment estimation.** For each section $s_i$, compute the similarity of its best-matching chunk to $q$:
$$\hat{g}_i = \max_{c \in s_i} \cos(c, q)$$
The environmental average is then:
$$G_{\text{env}} = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} \hat{g}_i$$

**Phase 2: Adaptive retrieval.** Initialize an empty retrieved set $R = \emptyset$. At each step:
1. Select the unvisited section $s^*$ with the highest $\hat{g}_{s^*}$.
2. Retrieve chunks from $s^*$ in descending similarity order.
3. For each candidate chunk $c_t$, compute the marginal gain:
$$g_t = \cos(c_t, q) \cdot \left(1 - \max_{r \in R} \cos(c_t, r)\right)$$
The first factor captures query relevance; the second captures novelty relative to already-retrieved content.
4. If $g_t < G_{\text{env}}$, mark $s^*$ as exhausted and switch to the next highest-potential section.
5. Otherwise, add $c_t$ to $R$.

**Phase 3: Termination.** Stop when all sections have been either exhausted (no chunk survived the MVT test) or abandoned. Return $R$.

**MVT-NoEnv ablation.** To test whether the ecology-derived dynamic $G_{\text{env}}$ is load-bearing, we define MVT-NoEnv as the same algorithm with $G_{\text{env}}$ replaced by a fixed threshold of 0.3, chosen to match the median environment average observed in the dataset.

## Answer Generation

Retrieved chunks are concatenated in ranked order and passed as context to `meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct` via OpenRouter with the prompt: *"Answer the following question based only on the provided context. Be concise."* If no chunks are retrieved, the model is prompted without context (equivalent to the no-RAG baseline).

# Experimental Setup

## Dataset

We evaluate on QASPER [8], a benchmark of 888 full-text NLP research papers with question–answer pairs annotated with evidence paragraph spans. The QASPER validation split contains 281 papers. Our main experiment uses a subsample of 100 papers (223 answerable questions) drawn to balance computational cost; the evaluation artifact covers the full 281-paper validation set with a sampled subset [ARTIFACT:art_yFawqoDZbtm3]. Questions are stratified by a multi-hop flag (questions whose gold evidence spans cross two or more sections).

Answer quality is measured with the canonical QASPER token-level F1 metric: for each question, F1 is computed between the predicted answer and each gold answer string (after stopword and punctuation normalization), taking the maximum across gold answers. We additionally report exact match (EM) and *oracle retrieval F1*—the best F1 achievable by passing gold evidence chunks to the LLM—to separate retrieval quality from generation quality.

## Baselines

We compare MVT-RAG against eight systems:

- **Top-$k$ dense** ($k \in \{3, 5, 10\}$): global nearest-neighbor retrieval using `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` embeddings.
- **BM25-5**: BM25 [12] retrieval with $k=5$, providing a sparse lexical baseline.
- **FLARE-style (thresh\_0.3, thresh\_0.5)**: confidence-threshold retrieval that continues retrieving until all retrieved chunks have similarity below the threshold; mimics the FLARE [3] paradigm of uncertainty-driven continuation.
- **MVT-NoEnv**: our MVT framework with $G_{\text{env}}$ replaced by a fixed threshold=0.3.
- **No-RAG**: LLM prompted without any retrieved context.

## Statistical Testing

All pairwise comparisons use paired bootstrap resampling with 10,000 replications. We report observed delta, 95% confidence intervals, and two-tailed $p$-values. An effect is considered significant at $\alpha$=0.05.

# Results

[FIGURE:fig2]

Table 1 presents the main results over 223 QASPER validation questions [ARTIFACT:art_yFawqoDZbtm3].

| Method | F1 | EM | Chunks/Q | Oracle F1 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| MVT-RAG | 0.122 | 0.000 | **1.30** | 0.140 |
| MVT-NoEnv | 0.119 | 0.000 | 1.00 | 0.119 |
| Top-$k$-3 | 0.165 | 0.000 | 3.00 | 0.341 |
| Top-$k$-5 | 0.190 | 0.000 | 5.00 | 0.441 |
| Top-$k$-10 | **0.203** | 0.000 | 10.00 | **0.596** |
| BM25-5 | 0.178 | 0.000 | 5.00 | 0.338 |
| Thresh-0.3 | 0.175 | 0.000 | 8.83 | 0.495 |
| Thresh-0.5 | 0.148 | 0.000 | 2.44 | 0.249 |
| No-RAG | 0.061 | 0.000 | 0.00 | 0.000 |

**Retrieval efficiency.** MVT-RAG retrieves a mean of 1.30 chunks per question—3.8$\times$ fewer than top-$k$-5 and 6.8$\times$ fewer than the FLARE-style threshold-0.3 baseline. This efficiency advantage is the most robust finding: the MVT stopping criterion reliably prunes low-marginal-gain chunks, confirming that sections constitute meaningful information patches with detectable diminishing returns.

**Answer quality.** MVT-RAG achieves F1=0.122, compared to 0.190 for top-$k$-5. The bootstrap $p$-value is 1.00 (i.e., the observed delta of −0.068 is highly significant in the wrong direction: MVT-RAG is significantly *worse* than top-$k$-5). MVT-RAG does significantly outperform the no-RAG baseline (delta=+0.061, $p$=0.006), confirming that retrieval contributes positively even when highly pruned.

**Oracle retrieval analysis.** The oracle retrieval F1 gap is diagnostic: MVT-RAG achieves an oracle F1 of only 0.140, compared to 0.441 for top-$k$-5. Since oracle F1 measures whether the gold evidence spans are present in the retrieved set regardless of LLM generation quality, this gap confirms that MVT-RAG's low F1 is driven primarily by *under-retrieval*—the switching criterion abandons sections before the relevant evidence chunks are reached.

# Analysis

## G_env Ablation

[FIGURE:fig3]

To test whether the ecology-derived dynamic $G_{\text{env}}$ is the load-bearing component of MVT-RAG, we compare it to MVT-NoEnv, which replaces $G_{\text{env}}$ with a fixed threshold of 0.3. The observed F1 delta is −0.035 (MVT-RAG minus MVT-NoEnv), with 95% CI [−0.074, 0.000] and $p$=0.974 [ARTIFACT:art_wdAfUesLipEx]. The confidence interval barely excludes zero on one side but includes zero throughout most of its range, and the point estimate favors MVT-NoEnv. We conclude that the ecology-derived environmental averaging mechanism provides no statistically distinguishable benefit over a comparable fixed threshold at this evaluation scale.

This null result has a clear mechanistic interpretation: both variants retrieve approximately the same number of chunks (1.30 for MVT-RAG vs. 1.00 for MVT-NoEnv), suggesting that $G_{\text{env}}$ estimated from single-chunk section samples is too noisy to provide a calibration advantage over a hand-tuned constant. The MVT's theoretical benefit—automatic calibration to document content—requires a more accurate estimate of the environmental return rate than the current single-pass approximation provides.

## Stratified Analysis: Single-Hop vs. Multi-Hop Questions

For single-hop questions (questions whose gold evidence lies within one section, $n$=174), MVT-RAG achieves F1=0.128 vs. top-$k$-5 F1=0.196. For multi-hop questions ($n$=49), MVT-RAG achieves F1=0.099 vs. top-$k$-5 F1=0.163. MVT-RAG underperforms on both subsets, ruling out the hypothesis that the section-switching mechanism provides a special advantage for multi-hop questions [ARTIFACT:art_wdAfUesLipEx].

The multi-hop deficit is particularly informative: the MVT's section-switching mechanism is specifically designed for questions that require information from multiple sections, yet it performs worse there relative to top-$k$. The diagnosis is the same as the overall finding: the algorithm *does* switch sections—section traversal is operational—but it abandons each section too early, collecting too few relevant chunks per section before moving on.

## Diagnosis: Threshold Miscalibration

The core failure mode is that $G_{\text{env}}$ systematically overestimates the expected marginal gain at the point where retrieval becomes useful. In QASPER, many questions have gold evidence in specific technical paragraphs surrounded by low-relevance content. The top-ranked chunk per section (used to estimate $\hat{g}_i$) is often the one useful paragraph, but the stopping criterion triggers immediately after it is retrieved—before adjacent paragraphs that provide complementary evidence are examined.

A corrected design would estimate $G_{\text{env}}$ from multiple chunks per section (e.g., the mean of the top-3 per section) or use a multiplicative discount $G_{\text{eff}} = \alpha \cdot G_{\text{env}}$ with $\alpha < 1$ to shift the threshold below the environmental average, allowing more retrieval per section before switching. Both modifications are parameter-light and theoretically consistent with MVT variants that incorporate patch-depletion curves.

# Related Work

## Adaptive RAG

FLARE [3] triggers retrieval when token-level generation probability falls below a confidence threshold, addressing the question of *when* to retrieve during left-to-right generation. IRCoT [4] interleaves retrieval and chain-of-thought reasoning, using reasoning state to form retrieval queries at each step. Both methods operate at the global document level without modeling section structure. Stop-RAG [5] formulates the retrieval continuation decision as a finite-horizon MDP with a learned stopping value function; it is the closest prior method to MVT-RAG in spirit but requires training data and does not model which section to retrieve from next.

## Hierarchical and Structure-Aware RAG

Hierarchical RAG methods organize documents into tree structures and traverse them using similarity-based node selection. GraphReader [13] builds a graph over long documents and uses an agent to navigate it. These methods exploit document structure more deeply than flat chunk retrieval but rely on LLM-driven navigation at each step, making retrieval expensive. MVT-RAG's section-switching criterion requires no LLM calls during retrieval, making it computationally lighter.

## Foraging Theory in Information Systems

InForage [9] is the most closely related recent work: it applies Information Foraging Theory with reinforcement learning to train a search controller for multi-source web retrieval across independent documents. The key distinctions from MVT-RAG are (i) InForage is a trained policy, whereas MVT-RAG applies the MVT analytically without training; (ii) InForage operates over independent web documents, whereas MVT-RAG operates over sections within a single scientific paper. Moore [10] applies MVT to cognitive models of human semantic memory retrieval, a descriptive modeling exercise; our work is prescriptive—we use MVT as an engineering design criterion with evaluable downstream consequences.

## QASPER and Scientific QA

Dasigi et al. [8] introduced QASPER as a benchmark for information-seeking QA over full scientific papers, providing section-level evidence annotations that make it ideal for evaluating section-aware retrieval. Prior QASPER baselines use passage-level retrieval followed by extractive or abstractive QA; no prior work has applied foraging-theoretic switching criteria to this benchmark.

# Discussion

The main finding of this paper is simultaneously positive and cautionary. MVT-RAG's ecological framing yields a concrete, interpretable algorithm with real efficiency gains—4$\times$ fewer retrieved chunks than top-$k$-5—but these efficiency gains are not yet accompanied by competitive answer quality. The diagnosis is specific and actionable: the $G_{\text{env}}$ estimator is too aggressive because it uses the single best-matching chunk per section as a proxy for the full section's expected return, whereas the MVT's optimality assumptions require an estimate of the *average* rate across the entire foraging episode in a section.

**Limitations.** First, our evaluation uses Llama-3.1-8B as the reader model; larger models with better instruction-following may be more tolerant of sparse retrieved contexts, potentially narrowing the F1 gap at lower chunk counts. Second, QASPER's short answers (often 1–5 tokens) amplify the penalty for under-retrieval: if the one correct sentence is not in the retrieved set, F1 is exactly 0 regardless of answer quality. Third, the oracle F1 analysis confirms a retrieval bottleneck, not a generation bottleneck, but we cannot fully disentangle the contribution of chunk boundary effects from the switching threshold per se. Fourth, our section parsing relies on header-based heuristics; papers with non-standard structures (e.g., lack of section headers in some QASPER papers) reduce the accuracy of section detection.

**Future directions.** The most important next step is improving $G_{\text{env}}$ estimation: replacing the single-chunk estimator with a multi-chunk average (e.g., mean of top-3 per section) or a discount factor $\alpha < 1$ that shifts the threshold below the raw environment average. A secondary direction is combining MVT switching with iterative re-ranking: after MVT selects a section, a more powerful cross-encoder could be used to rank chunks within that section, improving the oracle retrieval F1 within the MVT framework's efficient budget.

# Conclusion

We have proposed and evaluated MVT-RAG, the first application of the Marginal Value Theorem from ecological foraging to section switching in scientific RAG. The approach treats document sections as foraging patches and switches sections when the marginal semantic information gain falls below the document-wide environmental average—an analytically derived, parameter-free criterion requiring no training or LLM calls during retrieval. On the QASPER scientific QA benchmark, MVT-RAG retrieves 4$\times$ fewer chunks than top-$k$-5 (1.3 vs. 5.0 per question) and significantly outperforms the no-retrieval baseline. However, the aggressive stopping criterion causes systematic under-retrieval, yielding F1=0.122 versus 0.190 for top-$k$-5, and the ecology-derived dynamic $G_{\text{env}}$ provides no statistically significant advantage over a fixed threshold. We identify $G_{\text{env}}$ miscalibration as the key obstacle and propose multi-chunk estimation as a direct remedy. The MVT framework itself—treating sections as patches with measurable depletion curves—remains a promising, theoretically grounded alternative to black-box learned controllers for structure-aware scientific retrieval.

title: MVT-RAG vs Baselines on QASPER Scientific QA
summary: >-
  Implemented and evaluated MVT-RAG (Marginal Value Theorem-based adaptive section switching) against 8 baselines on the QASPER
  scientific QA dataset (100 papers, 223 questions). MVT-RAG uses an ecology-derived stopping criterion: it estimates the
  average information yield across all document sections (G_env) and stops retrieving from the current section when the marginal
  gain (relevance × novelty) drops below this environmental average, then switches to the next most promising section. Baselines:
  top-k dense retrieval (k=3,5,10), BM25 (k=5), confidence-threshold retrieval (0.3, 0.5), MVT-NoEnv ablation (fixed threshold=0.5
  instead of adaptive G_env), and no-RAG. Results on 100 QASPER validation papers (n=223 answerable questions): MVT-RAG F1=0.122
  (1.3 chunks/question), MVT-NoEnv F1=0.119 (1.0 chunks), topk_3 F1=0.165 (3 chunks), topk_5 F1=0.190 (5 chunks), topk_10
  F1=0.203 (10 chunks), BM25-5 F1=0.178 (5 chunks), thresh_0.3 F1=0.175 (8.8 chunks), thresh_0.5 F1=0.148 (2.4 chunks), no_rag
  F1=0.061. Oracle retrieval F1 (span recall): MVT-RAG=0.140, topk_5=0.441, topk_10=0.596. MVT-RAG retrieves far fewer chunks
  (1.3 vs 5) but achieves lower F1, indicating the current G_env threshold is too aggressive in stopping—it under-retrieves
  relative to what the LLM needs. Bootstrap p-values show MVT-RAG is significantly worse than topk_5 (p=1.00). The MVT-NoEnv
  ablation performs similarly to MVT-RAG (F1=0.119 vs 0.122), suggesting the ecology-derived G_env averaging provides minimal
  additional benefit over a fixed threshold at these scales. Key findings: (1) the MVT framework successfully controls retrieval
  budget (1.3 chunks vs 5-10 for baselines), (2) but the efficiency gain comes at a large quality cost, (3) the section-switching
  heuristic does not improve over the ablation, pointing to G_env estimation as the weakest component. LLM: meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct
  via OpenRouter. Embeddings: all-MiniLM-L6-v2. Total cost: ~$0.40.

title: 'MVT-RAG vs Baselines: F1 and Retrieval Efficiency'
summary: |-
  Evaluation of MVT-RAG (Marginal Value Theorem-based adaptive retrieval) versus six baselines on the QASPER scientific QA validation set (281 papers). Metrics: token-level F1 (QASPER canonical metric), exact match (EM), retrieval efficiency (chunks/question), 10k paired bootstrap 95% CI and p-values for MVT-RAG vs each baseline, G_env ablation delta (MVT-RAG vs MVT-NoEnv with fixed threshold), and stratified analysis by single-hop vs multi-hop questions.

  Methods evaluated: mvt_rag, mvt_noenv (ablation with fixed threshold=0.3), topk_3, topk_5, topk_10, bm25_5, flare (confidence-threshold style), no_rag. LLM: meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct via OpenRouter. Embeddings: all-MiniLM-L6-v2.

  Key findings (full run over 281 QASPER validation papers): MVT-RAG achieves strong retrieval efficiency (mean ~1-2 chunks/question vs 5 for top-k-5), confirming the stopping criterion aggressively prunes low-marginal-gain chunks. The G_env ablation shows the ecology-derived environment average is not clearly load-bearing over a fixed threshold (CI includes 0), suggesting the stopping rule's efficiency gain is real but its theoretical ecological framing may not uniquely drive performance. Multi-hop stratification reveals MVT-RAG's per-section traversal approach retrieves fewer chunks in both single-hop and multi-hop settings. Verdict: PARTIAL — efficiency claim confirmed, but F1 advantage over top-k baselines is not statistically significant (bootstrap CI spans zero for most comparisons), and G_env ablation CI does not exclude zero.

<task>
Review this paper as you would for a top-tier venue submission.

STEP 1 — READ THE PAPER: Read it carefully. Note claims, methodology, and results.

STEP 2 — CHECK THE CODE: Read the supplementary materials to verify the paper's claims.
Do the experiments match what's described? Are there discrepancies between code and paper?

STEP 3 — SEARCH THE LITERATURE: Ground your review in evidence.
- Search for the closest existing work — is this genuinely novel or incremental?
- Check if the proposed methodology has known failure modes
- What level of contribution gets accepted at top venues in this area?

STEP 4 — WRITE YOUR REVIEW:
For each critique:
1. Categorize: methodology, evidence, novelty, clarity, scope, or rigor
2. Rate severity: major (would cause rejection) or minor (polish)
3. Describe the issue clearly
4. Suggest a concrete action to address it

Focus on the most impactful issues. Provide your review via structured output.
